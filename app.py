    ## About

    üëã Hi, I'm all about innovation, problem-solving, and fostering teamwork to create impactful solutions that empower individuals. With 4+ years of experience in product management, I've gained expertise in the entire product life cycle, particularly in strategy, product design, and data planning.

    üöÄ Driven by a growing desire to validate and bring ideas to life independently, I've ventured into the realms of data and AI engineering. My recent projects have revolved around data planning and developing LLM applications. To advance into this realm, I'm currently pursuing a second master's degree in Information Systems at the University of Washington Foster School, focusing on AI, data warehousing, and cloud technology.

    üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me striking yoga poses or exploring the great outdoors on a hike. Let's not forget, adventures are best shared! So feel free to invite me if you're seeking partners to go bouldering, backpacking, or scuba diving! Who's up for the ride? Let's connect!
